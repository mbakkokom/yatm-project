Yet Another Task Manager
===

It's **yet another poorly thought of** project made for a mid-term assignment.
It was only for fun, an experiment to try [Google's Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) framework and web components, and IndexedDB using [Dexie.js](http://dexie.org). The project was since discontinued.

It's ridden of curled up _spaghetti_ async operation which is just good enough for my practical approach to good score. Have fun trying to work it out!

**Ps. It is known not to work on Firefox and I don't know why.**
